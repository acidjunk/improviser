The renderer uses lilypond to produce png's form the riff defined in the DB.

In most cases you can render by using:
python render_preview.py 

It will render all needed files for the webviews to ../static/images/rendered/
If you want to re-render a exercise or riff; just set isRendered to 0 and run python render_preview.py again.

Other script:
you can use copy_local_to_server.sh to copy a complete render to the server from your local workstation.
This of course means that you didn't do any changes on the server in default riffs and exercises.
