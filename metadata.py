"""
This script will query https://api.improviser.education for unrendered riffs. It will then render them and
upload the rendered/changed riffs to an Amazon S3 bucket and flag the riff as rendered via a second API call.

It has a check that ensures that only one instance can be running at the same time.

Note: for now python 3.4 compatible.
